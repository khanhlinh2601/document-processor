# Document Processor Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a complete serverless document processing pipeline using AWS CDK with the following components:

1. **Upload API** (API Gateway + Lambda)
2. **S3 Event Trigger** (Lambda)
3. **SQS Queue** for document processing tasks
4. **SQS Consumer** Lambda for processing documents

## Key Features

- **Structured Logging**: Implemented a custom Logger class with different log levels
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between handlers, services, and infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed messages are sent to a DLQ for analysis and reprocessing
- **Secure IAM Permissions**: Least privilege permissions for each Lambda function
- **CloudWatch Integration**: All logs are sent to CloudWatch for monitoring

## Implementation Details

### 1. Logger Implementation

- Created a flexible Logger class with DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR levels
- Added context to each log message for better traceability
- Configured log level via environment variables

### 2. S3 Event to SQS Pipeline

- S3 bucket triggers Lambda on ObjectCreated events
- Lambda extracts metadata and sends a structured message to SQS
- SQS provides decoupling between document upload and processing

### 3. Document Processing

- SQS Consumer Lambda processes documents asynchronously
- Implements retry logic with eventual DLQ routing for failed messages
- Maintains idempotency to prevent duplicate processing

### 4. Infrastructure as Code

- Used AWS CDK to define all infrastructure
- Created reusable constructs for S3 and SQS
- Implemented proper IAM permissions following the principle of least privilege

## Deployment

- Created a convenient deployment script (`deploy.sh`)
- Added comprehensive documentation in README.md
- Included architecture diagram for visual reference

## Testing

- Implemented unit tests for all core components
- Added integration tests for the pipeline
- Created test fixtures for S3 events and SQS messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Processing Capabilities**: Add document analysis, text extraction, or other processing features
2. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create a CloudWatch dashboard for monitoring the pipeline
3. **Alerting**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for error conditions
4. **API Authentication**: Add authentication to the API Gateway
5. **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for large numbers of documents
